# Day 2 – OSI Model Layers

## Application Layer (Layer 7)
This layer allows users to interact with network services.
Examples include web browsers and email clients.

## Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
This layer handles data formatting, encryption, and decryption.
It ensures data is readable by the receiving system.

## Session Layer (Layer 5)
This layer manages sessions between two systems.
It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.

## Transport Layer (Layer 4)
This layer ensures end-to-end communication.
It uses TCP for reliable delivery and UDP for faster delivery.

## Network Layer (Layer 3)
This layer routes data between different networks using IP addresses.
Routers operate at this layer.

## Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
This layer handles communication within the same network.
It uses MAC addresses and manages frames.

## Physical Layer (Layer 1)
This layer transmits raw bits over physical media such as cables or wireless signals.
