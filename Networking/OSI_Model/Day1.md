**1. What is the OSI Model?**

OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.
It is a conceptual framework, not a real device or software.
The OSI model explains how data moves from one computer to another in a network, step by step.

**2. Why was the OSI Model created?**

Earlier, different vendors used different networking standards.
This caused communication problems between systems.
The OSI model was created to:
Standardize network communication
Allow different systems to work together

**3. What is the purpose of the OSI Model?**

The OSI model helps us to:
Understand how networks work
Troubleshoot network problems
Identify where failures occur
Analyze attacks from a security perspective

4. How many layers are in the OSI Model?

The OSI model has 7 layers.
Each layer has a specific responsibility.
Data passes through each layer in order.

5. Real-world analogy

Think of the OSI model like a parcel delivery system:
Packaging the item
Writing the address
Transporting it
Delivering it to the receiver
Each step has a role, just like each OSI layer.

6. Why is the OSI Model important for Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity professionals use the OSI model to:
Identify where an attack occurs
Understand attack impact
Design layered security defenses
Without OSI, security becomes guesswork.

7. Key takeaway

The OSI model is not for memorization.
It is a thinking framework for networking and security.
